# CodeGoblin Security Policy

CodeGoblin is a private-first fork/customization of OpenCode. It preserves OpenCode's local provider/BYOK behavior while adding CodeGoblin-specific local image-output and hosted-provider scaffolds.

Security defaults for this fork:

- Do not commit provider API keys, Gemini keys, DeepSeek keys, Stripe secrets, production endpoints, personal access tokens, generated credentials, local databases, or logs.
- Local prompts, chats, files, and generated assets remain local by default.
- CodeGoblin hosted subscription/gateway code in this public fork is scaffold-only. Production keys, Stripe logic, pricing logic, and private business rules must live outside this repository.
- New key storage should follow OpenCode's existing local auth/config patterns unless there is a documented reason to do otherwise.

CodeGoblin is an independent fork/customization of OpenCode and is not affiliated with OpenCode, Anomaly, or their maintainers.

# Upstream OpenCode Security Notes

## IMPORTANT

We do not accept AI generated security reports. We receive a large number of
these and we absolutely do not have the resources to review them all. If you
submit one that will be an automatic ban from the project.

## Threat Model

### Overview

OpenCode is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs locally on your machine. It provides an agent system with access to powerful tools including shell execution, file operations, and web access.

### No Sandbox

OpenCode does **not** sandbox the agent. The permission system exists as a UX feature to help users stay aware of what actions the agent is taking - it prompts for confirmation before executing commands, writing files, etc. However, it is not designed to provide security isolation.

If you need true isolation, run OpenCode inside a Docker container or VM.

### Server Mode

Server mode is opt-in only. When enabled, set `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to require HTTP Basic Auth. Without this, the server runs unauthenticated (with a warning). It is the end user's responsibility to secure the server - any functionality it provides is not a vulnerability.

### Out of Scope

| Category                        | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server access when opted-in** | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior              |
| **Sandbox escapes**             | The permission system is not a sandbox (see above)                      |
| **LLM provider data handling**  | Data sent to your configured LLM provider is governed by their policies |
| **MCP server behavior**         | External MCP servers you configure are outside our trust boundary       |
| **Malicious config files**      | Users control their own config; modifying it is not an attack vector    |
